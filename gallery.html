    <h2>Event #1 - Welcome</h2>

    <p>Our first event for the 2022 academic year welcomed in over 50 women in computer science at UNC to learn 
        more about our club and meet fellow students. After a brief introduction of the officers and an icebreaker event,
         our first meeting concluded with a bracelet making event.</p>Search UNC WiCS

Hey guys! Something came up and I’m not going to be able to make the cohort meeting today due to a conflicting event. But I have drafted some instructions for what we were going to be working on. You guys are more than welcome to use the study room in the UL to work together.

I have included an example in the main gallery branch you just need to pull the code into your branch that we checked out from last meeting using git pull!! Everyone needs to pick an event to do and work on that in their own branch. After you get the code for your event, make sure to git push to your branch.

Will take a look at everyone’s code later. Sorry for the late notice, it was a last minute math symposium that I want to attend!
